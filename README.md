
## Overview
This project demonstrates cross lingual transfer learning for sentiment analysis. Using XLM-R (Cross-lingual RoBERTa), the model is trained on an English sentiment dataset and generalized to predict sentiment in Hindi (a low resource language), achieving an accuracy of 79% on the Hindi test data
## Features
- Trained on SST-2 english dataset.

- Performs sentiment analysis for a low resource Hindi dataset using cross-lignual transfer.

- Utilizes the XLM-R model for multilingual embeddings and generalisation.
## Dataset
- English Dataset : **SST-2**(https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/sst2) dataset used for training.

- Hindi Dataset: A publicly available dataset for binary sentiment analysis (positive and negative).
